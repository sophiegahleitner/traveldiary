## About traveldiary
Traveldiary is an application where user can save their memories about their holidays (country, time, experiences, photos and a lot more travel details). Each traveldiary can be set to 'public' so all other users can also see it. On the one hand the user can see all of his holidays on one sight and on the other hand it is possible to get inspired by other traveldiaries.
